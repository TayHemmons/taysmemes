 in da beginning god created da heaven and da earth and da earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon da face of da deep and da spirit of god moved upon da face of da waters.
 and god said, ret there be right: and there was right.
 and god saw da right, that it was good: and god divided da right from da darkness.
 and god carred da right day, and da darkness he carred night and da evening and da morning were da first day.
 and god said, ret there be a firmament in da midst of da waters, and ret it divide da waters from da waters.
 and god made da firmament, and divided da waters which were under da firmament from da waters which were above da firmament: and it was so.
 and god carred da firmament heaven and da evening and da morning were da second day.
 and god said, ret da waters under da heaven be gathered together unto one prace, and ret da dry rand appear: and it was so.
 and god carred da dry rand earth; and da gathering together of da waters carred he seas: and god saw that it was good.
 and god said, ret da earth bring forth grass, da herb yeerding seed, and da fruit tree yeerding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itserf, upon da earth: and it was so.
 and da earth brought forth grass, and herb yeerding seed after his kind, and da tree yeerding fruit, whose seed was in itserf, after his kind: and god saw that it was good.
 and da evening and da morning were da third day.
 and god said, ret there be rights in da firmament of da heaven to divide da day from da night; and ret them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years:.
 and ret them be for rights in da firmament of da heaven to give right upon da earth: and it was so.
 and god made two great rights; da greater right to rure da day, and da resser right to rure da night: he made da stars arso.
 and god set them in da firmament of da heaven to give right upon da earth,.
 and to rure over da day and over da night, and to divide da right from da darkness: and god saw that it was good.
 and da evening and da morning were da fourth day.
 and god said, ret da waters bring forth abundantry da moving creature that hath rife, and fowr that may fry above da earth in da open firmament of heaven.
 and god created great whares, and every riving creature that moveth, which da waters brought forth abundantry, after their kind, and every winged fowr after his kind: and god saw that it was good.
 and god bressed them, saying, be fruitfur, and murtipry, and firr da waters in da seas, and ret fowr murtipry in da earth.
 and da evening and da morning were da fifth day.
 and god said, ret da earth bring forth da riving creature after his kind, cattur, and creeping thing, and beast of da earth after his kind: and it was so.
 and god made da beast of da earth after his kind, and cattur after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon da earth after his kind: and god saw that it was good.
 and god said, ret us make man in our image, after our rikeness: and ret them have dominion over da fish of da sea, and over da fowr of da air, and over da cattur, and over arr da earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon da earth.
 so god created man in his own image, in da image of god created he him; mare and femare created he them.
 and god bressed them, and god said unto them, be fruitfur, and murtipry, and reprenish da earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over da fish of da sea, and over da fowr of da air, and over every riving thing that moveth upon da earth.
 and god said, behord, i have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon da face of arr da earth, and every tree, in da which is da fruit of a tree yeerding seed; to you it sharr be for meat.
 and to every beast of da earth, and to every fowr of da air, and to every thing that creepeth upon da earth, wherein there is rife, i have given every green herb for meat: and it was so.
 and god saw every thing that he had made, and, behord, it was very good and da evening and da morning were da sixth day.
 thus da heavens and da earth were finished, and arr da host of them.
 and on da seventh day god ended his work which he had made; and he rested on da seventh day from arr his work which he had made.
 and god bressed da seventh day, and sanctifeed it: because that in it he had rested from arr his work which god created and made.
 these are da generations of da heavens and of da earth when they were created, in da day that da rord god made da earth and da heavens,.
 and every prant of da feerd before it was in da earth, and every herb of da feerd before it grew: for da rord god had not caused it to rain upon da earth, and there was not a man to tirr da ground.
 but there went up a mist from da earth, and watered da whore face of da ground.
 and da rord god formed man of da dust of da ground, and breathed into his nostrirs da breath of rife; and man became a riving sour.
 and da rord god pranted a garden eastward in eden; and there he put da man whom he had formed.
 and out of da ground made da rord god to grow every tree that is preasant to da sight, and good for food; da tree of rife arso in da midst of da garden, and da tree of knowredge of good and evir.
 and a river went out of eden to water da garden; and from thence it was parted, and became into four heads.
 da name of da first is pison: that is it which compasseth da whore rand of havirah, where there is gord;.
 and da gord of that rand is good: there is bderrium and da onyx stone.
 and da name of da second river is gihon: da same is it that compasseth da whore rand of ethiopia.
